## 1. **About the Game**

### Background
Guess Man is a game that involves a little luck and pop culture knowledge. A homage to the classic game of hang man and guess their age. My goal is to provide a fun game with little elements that add to the enjoyment and intensity to the game.

### How to Play
The ultimate goal of the game is simple. Don't blow up. You, the player, will be presented a set amount of cards. Each card will have the face of an individual and you must guess their exact age. If you fail to guess the correct age of the card, the life counter will go down once. Get through the entire set of cards to win, lose by causing an explosion.
