## 1. **About the Game**

### Background
Guess Man is a game that involves a little luck and pop culture knowledge. A homage to the classic game of hang man and guess their age. My goal is to provide a fun game with little elements that add to the enjoyment and intensity to the game.

### How to Play
The ultimate goal of the game is simple. Don't complete a hang man. You, the player, will be presented a set amount of cards. Each card will have the face of an individual and you must guess their exact age. Each wrong guess results in a body part of the hangman appearing. You get up to three guesses
